        <li> "Tojo turned over all his Indian POWs to Bose's command, and in October 1943 Bose announced the creation of a Provisional Government of Azad ('Free') India, of which he became head of state, prime minister, minister of war, and minister of foreign affairs. Some two million Indians were living in Southeast Asia when the Japanese seized control of that region, and these emigrees were the first 'citizens' of that government, founded under the 'protection' of Japan and headquartered on the 'liberated' Andaman Islands. Bose declared war on the United States and Great Britain the day after his government was established."</li>
        <li>Azad Hind was a provisional government formed to liberate India with Japanese support, and based initially in the Japanese occupied Andaman Islands and later in Japanese occupied Singapore during World War II."</li>
